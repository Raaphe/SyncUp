- different short levels (4) that unlock different abilities (one for each level)
- an endless mode with unlimited waves of enemies that gets progressively harder with each level. Here only the abilities you unlocked can be used.
- Whenever the beat of the song hits, the enemy can flash a certain colour and be extra vulnerable (*Perfect Hit*).

### Level Design: Goal of each level
---

- Reach the end of the level without dying. For this I have in mind the level structure of a game like “anger foot” Where each level is very chaotic. Each level would have 3 different challenges (stars) that when completed would go towards unlocking new abilities. In anger foot these abilities can only be used once at a time but in Throsh it’d be nice if we could use all of our abilities in succession kind of like in ori and the will of the wisp.
