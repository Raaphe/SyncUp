##### *Abilities*
---
- ==*Time Freeze*==: Record scratches (3s), only hear footsteps and coughing, office kind of atmosphere/setting (theme of boredom).
- ==*Tracer Rewind*==: music rewinds as well.
- ==*Music Jam*==: Slows down the enemies making their perfect hits easier to attain. when the grenade is thrown, a small semi sphere appears, inside this sphere, time and music is slowed.
- ==*Earbud Grappler*==: Hooks enemies towards you using iems. (may cause enemies to turn camp maybe)
- ==*Sonic Wave*==: Sends a repulsive wave of sound inflicting minimal damage and causing knockback on enemies.
- ==*Rhythm Ricochet*==: Shots sent at the enemy will ricochet to nearest enemies ON BEAT. Like the captain America shield in Fornite.

##### *Mechanics:*
---
- ==*Perfect Hit*== : If the player hits 4 consecutive actions (dash, double jump, shot etc.) they get a Hud effect, extra speed and damage.
- ==*Dash*==: also invincible.
- ==*Finisher*==: This might be ambitious but Iâ€™d love to have a finishing animation for some of the enemies like in doom eternal. [https://youtu.be/izsPCR1nCrw?si=hbMIeC-yRPKhYa23](https://youtu.be/izsPCR1nCrw?si=hbMIeC-yRPKhYa23 "https://youtu.be/izsPCR1nCrw?si=hbMIeC-yRPKhYa23")
